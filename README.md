# Guppy

Guppy is a software update helper.

It checks for new releases, downloads them, and applies the new version.

# How it works
Guppy checks a release repository for new releases. The repository is an interfaces for services that will handle checking for updates, and then applying updates. At this time only the interface is described, implementations will come in a later release.
